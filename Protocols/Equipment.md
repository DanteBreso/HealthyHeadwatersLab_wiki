### Equipment Maintenance
Records of regular equipment maintenance, calibrations, and repairs are kept in **GLI - Healthy Headwaters Lab - General/Operations/Equipment and Supplies/Equipment_Maintenance_records.xlsx**. Please make sure to update the file when appropriate. If there is an issue with a piece of equipment, this should also be noted in the spreadsheet and let Alyssa know about it to make sure it gets fixed.  

The calibration and maintenance schedules are slightly different for different pieces of equipment, and details on those can be found in the equipment-specific pages linked above.
